        <h3>Our Story, so far</h3>
        <p>
          From feeding over 200 children in Mathare to providing safe spaces for
          young minds, empowering the youth through skill development, and
          supporting elderly women in Migori, our impact resonates through
          transformative actions that span across generations.

          <p>
            The journey started when Kelvin Otieno was in university. He had a
            habit of coming to Mathare frequently to give sweets to the children
            and play with them. On one particular day as he was doing the usual,
            a child approached him and asked him for food instead of sweets.
            This was very unusual to him, so he decided to visit the child’s
            home. Upon arriving, he found the mother, the sole breadwinner of
            the family,   very sick lying on the floor languishing in deep
            poverty as she could not afford to provide food for her family for
            two days. <br />
            <br />
            This experience touched Kelvin's heart to the core and this is where
            his passion to help the community was conceived. He realized that
            the problems he grew up with years ago in Mathare were still faced
            by children till date. Kelvin himself was born and brought up in
            Mathare slums and was not immune to challenges. He himself has been
            through a lot; going to bed hungry, insecurity in the area,
            violence, extreme poverty and lack, struggling to pay his own fees.
            <br />
            <br />
            With the little savings he had and help from friends in the
            university, he started a feeding program in 2017. He would prepare
            porridge and serve children to at least curb the hunger issues.
            That’s when Hope Compassion Center was born. So far more than 200
            children have benefited from this program.

              Mathare slums suffer frequent mysterious fires which pose
              prevalent risk to properties and the lives of people, children
              being the most affected. On one of the occasions, 7 children were
              burnt in a span of 3 months. The basis of this is because there is
              no safe space where children can be left while parents go to
              search for the daily needs of the family. Some parents lock their
              children in the house. This poses a great risk for the children.
              This again became a burden for Kelvin and he was determined to do
              something about it.

              In 2020, Kelvin met Sandra Van Dyke, a passionate philanthropist
              whose heart was in Africa. She sponsored the building of a safe
              space for kids, where we call it the kids hub; which consists of a
              daycare , and montessori education program for children aged
              between 9 months to 3 years. This center exists to provide a safe
              and secured place for children where they are well taken care of
              by a highly-trained and loving team.

        <h4>The Initiative Grows, and so does its Impact</h4>
        <div class="alt-section-right">
          <p>
            You will come to realize that the more you engage in community work,
            the more you identify the many gaps that need to be filled and that
            you are inspired to do even more and to transform the community at
            large. This urge has led us to aim at inspiring, empowering and
            transforming the community holistically; the youths, women, and the
            elderly in Migori.   <br />
            <br />
            Having recognized the need in the society, we were motivated to
            start a youth empowering initiative. This program brings together 25
            youths who meet every Thursday. With very few resources to survive
            in the city, and no skills at all has sabotaged our youths.  The
            delinquencies among the youth have contributed to stigma in the
            community. This hinders them from prospering and excelling in life.
            The project seeks to instill and ingrain the social norms and values
            in delinquent youth groups by developing a sense of responsibility
            and mindset shift in them.

          <p>
            Understanding, caring, and supporting the needs of the elderly is at
            the core of our values as well. In Migori we are supporting a group
            of more than 40 elderly women who had lost all hope in life and
            wished to die, due to hunger, oppression, and lack. We empower them
            through farming initiatives in the village. <br />
            <br />In Mathare we empower a group of more than 25 women to improve
            their livelihood throughfinancial literacy training, savings and
            skills training. So far, they have been trained on liquid soap
            making, candle making, and jelly making.

        <h4>Where we are now and where we aim to grow to</h4>
        <p>
           Over the years we have fed more than 200 children through the feeding
          program The livelihood of the women has improved through the skills
          training, financial mentorship, and economic empowerment programs.  In
          six months, we have offered safe space for more than 33 young children
          In six months, we have reached more than 25 youths through our youth
          empowerment initiative. We have empowered them through skills
          training, financial literacy training, mindset shift training, and
          offering them space to nurture their talents. Our youths are
          progressing well, and we managed to take one to school where he will
          be graduating in April 2024. Amongst them we have painters and artists
          who have excelled and through training and support they are able to
          make a living out of their talent. Through the years, more than 40
          elderly women in the village have been supported through the feeding
          program and farming initiative in the village.
