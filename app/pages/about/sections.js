                        The journey started when Kelvin Otieno was in university. He had a
                        habit of coming to Mathare frequently to give sweets to the
                        children and play with them. On one particular day as he was doing
                        the usual, a child approached him and asked him for food instead
                        of sweets. This was very unusual to him, so he decided to visit
                        the child’s home. Upon arriving, he found the mother, the sole
                        breadwinner of the family,   very sick lying on the floor
                        languishing in deep poverty as she could not afford to provide
                        food for her family for two days.
                        <br />
                        This experience touched Kelvin's heart to the core and this is
                        where his passion to help the community was conceived. He realized
                        that the problems he grew up with years ago in Mathare were still
                        faced by children till date. Kelvin himself was born and brought
                        up in Mathare slums and was not immune to challenges. He himself
                        has been through a lot; going to bed hungry, insecurity in the
                        area, violence, extreme poverty and lack, struggling to pay his
                        own fees.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        With the little savings he had and help from friends in the
                        university, he started a feeding program in 2017. He would prepare
                        porridge and serve children to at least curb the hunger issues.
                        That’s when Hope Compassion Center was born. So far more than 200
                        children have benefited
                        from this program.

                        Mathare slums suffer frequent mysterious fires which pose
                        prevalent risk to properties and the lives of people, children
                        being the most affected. On one of the occasions, 7 children
                        were burnt in a span of 3 months.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The basis of this is because
                        there is no safe space where children can be left while parents
                        go to search for the daily needs of the family. Some parents
                        lock their children in the house. This poses a great risk for
                        the children. This again became a burden for Kelvin and he was
                        determined to do something about it.

                        You will come to realize that the more you engage in community work, the more you identify the many gaps that need to be filled and that you are inspired to do even more and to transform the community at large. This urge has led us to aim at inspiring, empowering and transforming the community holistically; the youths, women, and the elderly in Migori.
                        <br /><br />
                        Having recognized the need in the society, we were motivated to start a youth empowering initiative. This program brings together 25 youths who meet every Thursday. With very few resources to survive in the city, and no skills at all has sabotaged our youths.  The delinquencies among the youth have contributed to stigma in the community. This hinders them from prospering and excelling in life. The project seeks to instill and ingrain the social norms and values in delinquent youth groups by developing a sense of responsibility and mindset shift in them.
